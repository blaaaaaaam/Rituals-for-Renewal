supporter: Rituals for Renewal was supported by the City of Sydney.
short: Rituals for Renewal invited artists living or working on Gadigal Country to share a series of reflections and gestures in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Having undergone a collective period of isolation and introspection, where previous ways were called into question, the project considered how rituals might help us to re-imagine ourselves, our communities and our world.

Unfolding on the Instagram account <a href="https://instagram.com/ritualsforrenewal" target="_blank">@ritualsforrenewal</a> from August to December 2020, artists were invited to participate and in turn were encouraged to nominate another artist to take part and deepen the collective reservoir of thought.

Rituals for Renewal was created on the unceded lands of the Gadigal people. We pay respects to Elders past, present and emerging, and acknowledge their ongoing custodianship of land and culture, from time immemorial into the future.

The project was supported by the City of Sydney.
