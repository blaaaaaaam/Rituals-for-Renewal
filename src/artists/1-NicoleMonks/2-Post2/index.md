The grinding stone is a commonly used tool by our ancestors to mill, grind and pound bulbs, berries, seeds and ochre.

Working the rocks surfaces together until we find the sweet spot in the palm of the hand, this circular repetitive action evokes memories that are interwoven within our bones, and as we listened we wondered was it the rock making the sound, the sand or the echo in between...

We acknowledge the local South Coast mob, the continuing custodians of the land on which this artwork was created.
