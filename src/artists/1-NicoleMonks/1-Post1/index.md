Slowing down and watching a child connect with the world, warms the softest spaces of my heart. This intergenerational artwork with my son Bidi-Bidi was made on Warrain Beach from gathering shells and seaweed we found along our walk. After we made the work, we wonder how many days it might last, was it the ocean that would reclaimed its belongings, or the sand, or the wind or all of them interconnected?.

We acknowledge the local South Coast mob, the continuing custodians of the land on which this artwork was created.
