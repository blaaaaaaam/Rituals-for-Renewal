Connecting to place and space
Feeling the textures, the weight, the balance and the everything of nothingness

Is it possible to create a portal to new ways of understanding the world...

As we balanced the rock on the burnt sticks to create a void we wondered does the space exist because we create it or had it always existed right there in front of us?

We acknowledge the local South Coast mob, the continuing custodians of the land on which this artwork was created.
