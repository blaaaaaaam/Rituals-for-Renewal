These natural elements hold sacred knowledge and we too are made up of the same, this knowledge penetrates everything we know today and radiates energy from the beginning of time.<br><br>

The intention for my Rituals for Renewal posts is to slow down, make space and remember this innate connection and interconnection to Country.<br><br>

Since time immemorial Aboriginal people have been the continuing custodians of this country now known as Australia. This land, its oceans and skies, and miyarnu* have provided everything.

These natural elements hold sacred knowledge and we too are made up of the same, this knowledge penetrates everything we know today and radiates energy from the beginning of time.

The intention for my Rituals for Renewal posts is to slow down, make space and remember this innate connection and interconnection to Country.

*miyarnu - Knowing (Wajarri)
