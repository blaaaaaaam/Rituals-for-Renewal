  - "Text reads: Is there anything you’ve learnt as a chronically ill and disabled person that has helped you during the pandemic? This is my second pandemic (or maybe even my third) – I have been severely immunocompromised to the extent that the common cold or flu would have killed me. Because of this I have been socially isolated since mid-2017. Life was very difficult for me from then. Once the pandemic had well and truly taken hold, life strangely became a little easier for me. With the advent of tele-everything (tele-health, tele-physiologists, tele-double-dates). I didn’t have to travel for the hundreds of medical appointments I have. I wasn’t excluded from social gatherings because I didn’t have the physical capacity to attend."
  - "Text reads: There were articles everywhere on how to cope with and defeat the mental health monsters of extended isolation. Suddenly able-bodied people were in as much danger as I had been for 2 and a bit years and now there were the systems and resources in place to help protect them, and then.. myself… as a by-product. I learnt that the difficulty I was experiencing wasn’t due to myself but due to the social and systemic failings and lack of support for people like myself. It’s not that I couldn’t, it’s that I wasn’t catered for. Thought of."
