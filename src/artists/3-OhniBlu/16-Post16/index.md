  - "Text reads: What do you wish able bodied people or the general public would understand about your experience as a chronically ill and disabled person during the pandemic? *BIG sigh* I know it’s difficult being on lockdown. I’ve been doing it for a few years now. Please remember that, while it may be hard there is an enormous amount of support for you out there now. Support I’ve never had before. I would love for able-bodied people and the general public to understand that for some of us - what you’re experiencing right now - there is no end-date, and this started a long time ago. The pandemic will end, but the experiences of disabled and chronically ill people will not. And our difficulties will not. Please, don’t forget about the crips on the other side of the pandemic."
