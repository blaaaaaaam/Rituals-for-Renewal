Because swimming for me, you know, if I am in a lot of pain I can just swim really slowly but I can still swim. The waters buoyant I can even walk under water or move under water and the buoyancy of it allows my joints to keep moving which ultimately helps with control of my pain. So yeah I think I really really miss not being able to go to the local pool."
