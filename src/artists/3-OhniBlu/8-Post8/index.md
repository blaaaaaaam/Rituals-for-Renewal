  - "Text reads: What do you wish able bodied people or the general public would understand about your experience as a chronically ill and disabled person during the pandemic?"
  - "Text reads: This is every day for me. Different severities, but this restricted way of living, it’s every day. Lockdown, restrictions on movement, not seeing people, feeling crap. That’s me all day, every day, especially during a particularly bad time with my health."
  - "Text reads: I am frustrated to be honest. It took a pandemic for systemic forces to perform visible care; ads on tv, financial aid, increased Medicare response. And even then, it’s for all, not for those who already struggle."
  - "Text reads: We need extra care. This is the bare bones of what a disabled or chronically ill person might need. Why did it take mass global illness and death for those of us already ill to have access to what we’ve needed all along?"
  - "Text reads:  want people to think of their reactions to the pandemic, restrictions out in place, and now I want you think about this is your every day, except: You can only go out for an hour, but because after that you’re in too much pain."
  - "Text reads: You can’t go to work, but it’s because you’re not able to work. You can’t socialise, but it’s because you’re not doing well and you’re worried you’ll be a burden on your able bodied friends."
