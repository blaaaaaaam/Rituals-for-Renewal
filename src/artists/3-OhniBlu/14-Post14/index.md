  - "Text reads: What do you wish able bodied people or the general public would understand about your experience as a chronically ill and disabled person during the pandemic?"
  - "Text reads: It’s been said enough but often forgotten. If you don’t see it or if the person is acting “fine” it doesn’t mean they aren’t ill or in pain anymore. It is CONSTANT. It can be genuinely exhausting and at times, feeling like the downer, to constantly need to bring it up or explain why you can’t do a certain thing even though one passes like they can do it fine."
  - "Text reads: It also creates pressure where you feel like you need to do something that seems so easy to others but is debilitating to us. Whether it’s a big or small task, it all adds up. I guess, empathy. I often wish so deeply that I can transfer what I am experiencing to others just so they know what it feels like. I am not willing to do the job, it just if I do, I risk harming my body more than it is."
