  - "Text reads: Is there anything you’ve learnt as a chronically ill and disabled person that has helped you during the pandemic? Yes definitely umm resilience. I realised that listening to complaints from other work colleagues about teaching online and the difficulties they were facing with it. I actually… I rose to the challenge. I found it exciting, it was like having to learn new methods of working. Having to think outside the square to solve the problems. And they’re all skills as a disabled person that you’re using all the time because you are forever trying to think okay well how do I do this when I can’t just use brute force or I can’t lift something or move something or do the art that I want to do? I need to think outside the box to be able to come up with a solution so I can make art without draining or deleting my energies and I found very much that I was excited by the challenge. I really I loved you know experimenting with cyanotype and playing with pochoir. It was just fantastic and when I taught online my students picked up on that enthusiasm that I felt that this was an opportunity to be really experimental to try something completely new that we don’t usually use and to just play to have to give ourselves a chance to play with it and see what comes of it trying to make the best of the situation we’re facing rather than focusing on the negatives of what we couldn’t do."
