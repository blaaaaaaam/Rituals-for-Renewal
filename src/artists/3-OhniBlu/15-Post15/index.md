  - "Text reads: What is a challenge that you didn’t expect or struggled with during the pandemic?"
  - "Text reads: Due to my numerous pre-existing conditions I felt anxious about getting covid and the potential for it to have serious consequences for me."
  - "Text reads: Negotiating boundaries with my partner and my friends has been a really strange and difficult experience for me. I don’t share the same boundaries around covid precautions with a lot of friends."
  - "Text reads: It’s been hard to navigate that while not wanting to make anyone feel uncomfortable or rejected. Lots of my able-bodied friends seem to get tired pretty fast of being careful and then completely dropped any sort of effort to have consent or communication around precautions while hanging out."
