  - "Text reads: What is a challenge you didn't expect or struggled with during the pandemic? I never thought I could get sick of public parks and open air and nature, but I am so sick of it. The place I hated to be the most, before the pandemic, was a loud chaotic pub but now I just feel desperate. I don’t think I really enjoy those spaces. I just... I want to be able to choose it. Or not choose it. I don’t want it forced by health concerns. And I’m surprised with all the trouble that’s going on, that’s the thing that I’m hung up on."
