  - "Text reads: What do you wish able bodied people or the general public would understand about your experience as a chronically ill and disabled person during the pandemic? I think one of the things that’s been bizarrely difficult is with all these anti maskers people there’s so much pressure to do all of the normal precautions and some of those things just aren’t right for me. Like trying to go into a shop right now and they want you to use their hand sanitiser but half the time it's a gel hand sanitiser and that stuff builds up on your hands and gets on your wheelchair push rims and then a tiny drop of rain and suddenly your wheelchair is as slimy as a fish fresh out of the ocean and you’re just rolling into a highway. It’s no good. I can’t be using some random hand sanitiser. I can’t do it."
