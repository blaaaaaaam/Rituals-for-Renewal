  - "There is a line drawing of an eagle appearing in moments. Text reads: Ritual for connecting to change. Stand in a place where you are connected to nature. Close our eyes And feel the stirrings of the wind. Take a breath of this healing energy. Ask the wind to carry your prayer into the universe. Ask for only your highest good to be manifested. Give thanks for this blessing of a new season and cycle of growth and opportunities."
