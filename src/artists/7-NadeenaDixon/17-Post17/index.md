  - "Text on a background collage of watercolour brushstrokes reads: 'Ritual for Honouring Playfulness. Play is a sacred space to connect and honour your child spirit. When was the last time you were silly. Sillyness is your souls way to connect to fun. Stop what your doing now and think about something you loved as a child. Write down 5 things that make you happy. Plan to do 1 item on your list every day. Get ready to play.'"
