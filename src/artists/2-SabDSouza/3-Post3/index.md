As promised, here’s a further reading list based off of references from my IGTV video essay. I’d highly recommend Rowe & Royster’s journal introduction which touches on a lot of different theorists work on affective communities/emotions in justice movements, though it’s US focused. But it’s short! You can find some but not all in the linktree in this accounts bio.

Also this is my last little ~ritual~ for this digital residency.
