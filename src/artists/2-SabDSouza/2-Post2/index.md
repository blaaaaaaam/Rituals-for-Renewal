Difficult Feelings, The Black Square & Instagram

I associate the notion of rituals with that of intentional action. Being mindful of the way our bodies move in certain spaces, of comfort and ease. At the same time, I consider how these ideas might permeate into our digital movements and encounters online. This video essay considers the ways non-Bla(c)k people centre our feelings in anti-racist work, using the events of #BlackOutTuesday as a digital case study. It is not a critique of the digital action, or Bla(c)kLivesMatter, but rather a way to consider how our (non-Bla(c)k) emotions reflect colonial narratives and restage themselves online.

This video is captioned and a full transcript is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rvwk-h_y0NsuE1n1RS7VpVZiGB4fA5G8HzFZTPzzZLs/edit" target="_blank">here</a>.
