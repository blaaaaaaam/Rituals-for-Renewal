description: "What difficult feelings arise as we meet upon the common ground?<br><br>

What contexts, narratives and histories are carried into social media through the very act of treading?<br><br>

This ground, like all digital spaces, is not neutral. It is neither static, nor liminal. It is not a third space. This ground is tethered to its history. As routers connect us to a myriad of global networks, so too do they speak back to the land from which we access it. Entangled with the ongoing colonial histories that shape us and our digital infrastructures.<br><br>

It is here, as a settler invader, living & working on Gadigial land, I hold these complexities to account. I acknowledge that this ground is not always safe. Nor is it inherently a network of care or mutual aid. It is not a replacement for community. It is not everyone’s medium.<br><br>

But it is mine.<br><br>

So, I’ll share how emergent digital communities can be better understood through acts of feeling— online. I want to remind us of the painful tensions that arise when we attempt to be together. I wanna remember that joy doesn't negate pain. I want to see the little x at the end of a text message as a gift and not an ending. This ritual is non-exhaustive, unsettled and in flux."
