  - "Quote reads: Excerpt from: Re-imagining Communities. Sarah Ahmed"
  - "Quote reads: we need to distinguish between different sets of complex social relationships, many of which cannot be folded into ‘community’. When are relationships and encounters, exchanges, dialogues, forms of co-presence and coexistence, about ‘community’ and when are they about family, the re-enactment of ‘tradition’, remembrances, dreams, sites of momentary connections or disconnections, political mobilization, intimations of past lives and imagined futures? (on an orange and green gradient)"
  - "Quote reads: For us, to be unsettled by the very word ‘community’ is to remind ourselves that the word ‘community’ might not name all it is that we can do and can be when we ‘get together’. If we can return in conclusion to the idea of community as ‘common ground’ rather than commonality, we might think of communities as effects of how we meet on the ground, as a ground that is material, but also virtual, real and imaginary. (on an orange and green gradient background)"
  - "Quote reads: This ground that is ‘common’ is an effect of the meetings we have with others and the tread of feet that are weary across the land –a treading that shapes the land to come and allows it to surface differently. As we meet, we might in some sense (re)make the ground for a different kind of community, one that might not even be named by the word ‘community’, in which the ‘passing by’ of others allows something else to give.

The common ground, the basis for my work/ritual/research this week, is derived from Ahmed & Fortier’s Re-imagining Communities. I think it unsettles a lot of the issues present with our new reliance on digital media as a type of community.

Arts orgs / galleries / artists need to carefully examine how they devise and transform their ~digital~ content rn. This push towards live talks/streams in replacement of events does not fulfil the affective role that they would have otherwise served their cohort (not community).

This pandemic has shifted many arts ecologies online, facilitating access to talks, lectures, and cultural content that probably should have already been available through these mediums.

Still, there is necessary & vital work to be done on art that intersects with digital platforms, on how it employs, and relies on digital infrastructures (Think Facebook Live or this Instagram account) which ultimately serve to perpetuate their role in US global imperialism.  What would a collective of people look like outside of these frameworks? How do these infrastructures impact the way we get together right now?
