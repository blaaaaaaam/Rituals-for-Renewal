  - "The camera keeps slipping on this scene and there are glimpses of blurry hands trying to correct the problem. Finally, the camera stays fixed and two hands reach out, grasping lengths of parsely gone to seed, bringing them together and tying a bow from the heads of two stalks so that they bend to form an arch, joined at their head, and also at their root."

I'd like to try turning an idea into something using my hands, but 2 hands are needed and that leaves... no hands to film it.

I am at home, as we have all been over these past months, but it feels rare and special to be alone now, in a way that I never appreciated. And hard to be alone in a way that I so often ignored.

I try to nestle my phone in the hollow between my chin and clavicle. It keeps sliding. You watch it slip; you watch me slip. I keep catching it. Maybe this isn't going to work. And then, just like that, it holds.

My hands move quickly, working towards each other; this is the moment I have to act, and who knows how many more of these moments there will be, or how long they may last?

This would be so much easier with more than 2 hands.
