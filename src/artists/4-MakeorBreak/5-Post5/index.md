A scent carries you, stretching your fibres, tugging at your veins, spanning a bridge between moments, memories. Elaborate architectures spring up on either side.

I am riding - or walking - and that bridge reaches out to me from the sweat behind my knees, a hidden backyard or the shadowy drapery of a back alley fence. I am taken, splayed across multitudes... across times and locations and associations all at once.

It is heavy, drunken, thick with possibility and promise.

I bury my face in it when I can. And I remember.
