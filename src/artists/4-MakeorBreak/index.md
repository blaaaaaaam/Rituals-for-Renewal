description: "This year we made a project about bridges on the other side of the world, and we’ve been trying to make bridges to it since. To connect with it, draw it out, make it mean something. To create connections between continents and languages, and engage with strangers when we can’t be face to face, share a cuppa, share silence.
<br><br>
For Rituals for Renewal, we’re starting a daily ritual that is small, contained and introspective. It’s a way of examining that project, but no longer trying to cast a web across the world. Seeing what happens when we build things with materials and objects close to hand, and use this as a way of thinking from the inside out.
<br><br>
This ritual is an antidote to making work we cannot see or touch; a return to using our hands for something other than typing emails. We will be making, thinking and posting from the unceded lands of the Gadigal and Wangal people of the Eora Nation, and the Burramattagal people of the Darug Nation. We acknowledge their ongoing practices of making, thinking and sharing on, of and with these lands, with an awareness that we are beneficiaries of the ongoing colonial project.
<br><br>
The thoughts we share here have their roots in the project <a href='https://www.instagram.com/careforbridges/'>@careforbridges</a>."
