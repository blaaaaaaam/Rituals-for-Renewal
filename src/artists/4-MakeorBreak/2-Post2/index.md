  - "A short video of a bridge-type structure."
longdesc:
  - "The two ends are stacks of a jar and wooden dowel, then a roll of gaffa tape, another jar and a dog toy. A painted aluminium sheet is laid horizontally across them. A hand appears and two fingers walk carefully across the sheet. They jump off the other end and scurry out of frame."

I am makeshift, provisional, impermanent. A conglomerate of things that would never come into contact, except to form this temporary structure in space. Parts of me have seen the sharp edge of a blade, the bristles of a paintbrush, the inside of a dog’s mouth. Now the oily pads of fingers, walking, tickling, marking space and time. I hold fast but am tethered to my own precarity. I am bridge as obstacle, not thoroughfare. I am a reminder –

That the easiest way is not always the best.

That there are always unseen things to be crossed over or connected.

That climbing up and then down again is one way to gain perspective.
