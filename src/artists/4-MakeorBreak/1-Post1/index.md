  - "A slow-moving video that follows a spool of copper-coloured nylon thread bridging a distance between a floor and a wall."

  - "It is shot very close-up and keeps falling out of focus, dividing the field of view in half vertically. There is ambient background noise: voices, foot scuffing, and machine noise in the distance."

Bridge 1

I am coiled, around myself. Always surrounded by myself. It can be suffocating. My fibres nano-hard, angular, scratching, rubbing; my whole flexible, pliant, they even call me 'soft'. Slid between others like me, I can feel myself crawled along spines, so long that I forget where I end and begin. I am pushed against bones, books, pulled into knots, veiled, staring up through skirts, or your pant leg. I recoil.
