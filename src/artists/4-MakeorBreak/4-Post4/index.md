If a bridge is anything formed to ease passage over a drop, a dip or a potential fall, then bridges are everywhere. A spider’s web is a series of bridges - but also a home, and a trap. I’m on a friend’s deck and gum leaves have fallen across gaps in the boards. Gentle, temporary bridges across tiny abysses. Just under a year ago the leaves here were all black and charred, or ash-soft and grey. Today the colours are back, there is a cool breeze, and things feel held – suspended – at least for now.
