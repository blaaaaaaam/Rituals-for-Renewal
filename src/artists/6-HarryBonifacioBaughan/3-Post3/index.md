Life is hard, so do I have to be hard too?

I'm trying to pray every night before I sleep. I've been trying to read the Bible again. I've been trying to be stubborn in my belief that none of this is permanent. I've been trying to renew heart in a world that threatens to slowly erode yours away. I've been listening to sermons while I work out on my bedroom floor. It might be some weird way of embodying spiritual growth or it might be a self-punishing ideal that Filipino Catholics can be known for. I wish I could say I was devout, or faithful, or committed to spiritual practice. The truth is I'm not. But having faith, I'm realising, is knowing in your heart the truth - that love and justice do bind us together; that everyone has intrinsic, untouchable value; and that one day, the artifice built to disrespect this must crumble away. Everyday I water a fledgling plant knowing one day it will grow into a tree with a large, strong trunk - one that I hope will outlive me and provide fruit long after I'm gone.
