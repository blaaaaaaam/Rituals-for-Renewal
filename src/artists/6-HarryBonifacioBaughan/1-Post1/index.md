Everything must come to an end.

I've always had trouble envisioning the future, but spending time each day sketching a clear picture of one I'd like to see everyday is helping me ground myself and face the right direction. Around where I live, I see kids running through the broken fences of different blocks without a care. I'd love to see the red brick apartment blocks free to flourish. I'm just about to finish up a Horticulture apprenticeship because I have a friend who dreams of reclaiming and healing his land, and another who wants to feed their neighbourhood. To be honest, I'd love to see these fences rid of entirely so we can grow fresh fruit and vegetables for all the kids on the block. While that might not be in the immediate future, I know at the very least I'm sharpening my skills and gaining the tools to plant those seeds. I wonder what might grow out of the ruins.
