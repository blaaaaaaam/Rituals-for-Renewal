God gives us what we can handle.

I wish these past few months was a period of quiet meditation, but for many people (including myself), I know it wasn't. I spent a lot of time wrestling with God and struggling with my demons. Many I realised had been haunting me for years. But I've also learnt to meet reality on it's own terms and see things plainly for what they are. I've become aware of my own need for a strong foundation, a firm core and roots that run deep enough to weather a storm. I didn't get the period of quiet meditation I was hoping for, but nothing is really promised to us is it? Regardless, I'm determined to regain my footing and turn this hard-earned, newfound awareness into embodied change. The realisation I keep returning to is that we rarely are afforded the luxury of quiet study - we've got to learn on our feet.
