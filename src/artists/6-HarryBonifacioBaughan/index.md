description: "Recently, we've seen actually how fragile this world is. New cracks are appearing in the (capitalist/settler-colonial) facade, through which we can see small glimpses of another world. What role will we play cultivating their growth? It's important to have faith in them the same way we know a small sprout can one day be infallible old growth. We all have a role to play, and we can't afford to lose hope."
