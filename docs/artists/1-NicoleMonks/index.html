  Since time immemorial Aboriginal people have been the continuing custodians of
  this country now known as Australia. This land, its oceans and skies, and
  miyarnu* have provided everything.
</p>
<p>
  These natural elements hold sacred knowledge and we too are made up of the
  same, this knowledge penetrates everything we know today and radiates energy
  from the beginning of time.

<p>
  The intention for my Rituals for Renewal posts is to slow down, make space and
  remember this innate connection and interconnection to Country.
