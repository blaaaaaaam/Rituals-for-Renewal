                Having undergone a collective period of isolation and
                introspection, where previous ways were called into question,
                the project considered how rituals might help us to re-imagine
                ourselves, our communities and our world.

                from August to December 2020, artists were invited to
                participate and in turn were encouraged to nominate another
                artist to take part and deepen the collective reservoir of
                thought.

                Rituals for Renewal was created on the unceded lands of the
                Gadigal people. We pay respects to Elders past, present and
                emerging, and acknowledge their ongoing custodianship of land
                and culture, from time immemorial into the future.

              Since time immemorial Aboriginal people have been the continuing
              custodians of this country now known as Australia. This land, its
              oceans and skies, and miyarnu* have provided everything.<br /><br />
              These natural elements hold sacred knowledge and we too are made
              up of the same, this knowledge penetrates everything we know today
              and radiates energy from the beginning of time.<br /><br />
              The intention for my Rituals for Renewal posts is to slow down,
              make space and remember this innate connection and interconnection

                  Slowing down and watching a child connect with the world,
                  warms the softest spaces of my heart. This intergenerational
                  artwork with my son Bidi-Bidi was made on Warrain Beach from
                  gathering shells and seaweed we found along our walk. After we
                  made the work, we wonder how many days it might last, was it
                  the ocean that would reclaimed its belongings, or the sand, or
                  the wind or all of them interconnected?.

              What difficult feelings arise as we meet upon the common
              ground?<br /><br />
              What contexts, narratives and histories are carried into social
              media through the very act of treading?<br /><br />
              This ground, like all digital spaces, is not neutral. It is
              neither static, nor liminal. It is not a third space. This ground
              is tethered to its history. As routers connect us to a myriad of
              global networks, so too do they speak back to the land from which
              we access it. Entangled with the ongoing colonial histories that

              this ground is not always safe. Nor is it inherently a network of
              care or mutual aid. It is not a replacement for community. It is
              not everyone’s medium.<br /><br />
              But it is mine.<br /><br />
              So, I’ll share how emergent digital communities can be better
              understood through acts of feeling— online. I want to remind us of
              the painful tensions that arise when we attempt to be together. I
              wanna remember that joy doesn't negate pain. I want to see the
              little x at the end of a text message as a gift and not an ending.
              This ritual is non-exhaustive, unsettled and in flux.

                  The common ground, the basis for my work/ritual/research this
                  week, is derived from Ahmed &amp; Fortier’s Re-imagining
                  Communities. I think it unsettles a lot of the issues present
                  with our new reliance on digital media as a type of community.

                  Arts orgs / galleries / artists need to carefully examine how
                  they devise and transform their ~digital~ content rn. This
                  push towards live talks/streams in replacement of events does
                  not fulfil the affective role that they would have otherwise
                  served their cohort (not community).
                </p>
                <p>
                  This pandemic has shifted many arts ecologies online,
                  facilitating access to talks, lectures, and cultural content
                  that probably should have already been available through these
                  mediums.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Still, there is necessary &amp; vital work to be done on art
                  that intersects with digital platforms, on how it employs, and
                  relies on digital infrastructures (Think Facebook Live or this
                  Instagram account) which ultimately serve to perpetuate their
                  role in US global imperialism. What would a collective of
                  people look like outside of these frameworks? How do these
                  infrastructures impact the way we get together right now?

                  I associate the notion of rituals with that of intentional
                  action. Being mindful of the way our bodies move in certain
                  spaces, of comfort and ease. At the same time, I consider how
                  these ideas might permeate into our digital movements and
                  encounters online. This video essay considers the ways
                  non-Bla(c)k people centre our feelings in anti-racist work,
                  using the events of #BlackOutTuesday as a digital case study.
                  It is not a critique of the digital action, or
                  Bla(c)kLivesMatter, but rather a way to consider how our
                  (non-Bla(c)k) emotions reflect colonial narratives and restage
                  themselves online.

                  As promised, here’s a further reading list based off of
                  references from my IGTV video essay. I’d highly recommend Rowe
                  &amp; Royster’s journal introduction which touches on a lot of
                  different theorists work on affective communities/emotions in
                  justice movements, though it’s US focused. But it’s short! You
                  can find some but not all in the linktree in this accounts

              Right now there is a global pandemic happening. A world wide
              health crisis. Chronically ill and disabled people have unique
              perceptions of this time based on enduring our own ongoing health
              crises. Our voices and lives are often ignored and erased so I
              choose to platform them in this space. 💛

I realised that listening to complaints from other work colleagues about teaching online and the difficulties they were facing with it. I actually… I rose to the challenge. I found it exciting, it was like having to learn new methods of working. Having to think outside the square to solve the problems. And they’re all skills as a disabled person that you’re using all the time because you are forever trying to think okay well how do I do this when I can’t just use brute force or I can’t lift something or move something or do the art that I want to do? I need to think outside the box to be able to come up with a solution so I can make art without draining or deleting my energies and I found very much that I was excited by the challenge. I really I loved you know experimenting with cyanotype and playing with pochoir. It was just fantastic and when I taught online my students picked up on that enthusiasm that I felt that this was an opportunity to be really experimental to try something completely new that we don’t usually use and to just play to have to give ourselves a chance to play with it and see what comes of it trying to make the best of the situation we’re facing rather than focusing on the negatives of what we couldn’t do."

Like trying to go into a shop right now and they want you to use their hand sanitiser but half the time it&#39;s a gel hand sanitiser and that stuff builds up on your hands and gets on your wheelchair push rims and then a tiny drop of rain and suddenly your wheelchair is as slimy as a fish fresh out of the ocean and you’re just rolling into a highway. It’s no good. I can’t be using some random hand sanitiser. I can’t do it."

              This year we made a project about bridges on the other side of the
              world, and we’ve been trying to make bridges to it since. To
              connect with it, draw it out, make it mean something. To create
              connections between continents and languages, and engage with
              strangers when we can’t be face to face, share a cuppa, share
              silence. <br /><br />
              For Rituals for Renewal, we’re starting a daily ritual that is
              small, contained and introspective. It’s a way of examining that
              project, but no longer trying to cast a web across the world.
              Seeing what happens when we build things with materials and
              objects close to hand, and use this as a way of thinking from the
              inside out. <br /><br />
              This ritual is an antidote to making work we cannot see or touch;
              a return to using our hands for something other than typing
              emails. We will be making, thinking and posting from the unceded
              lands of the Gadigal and Wangal people of the Eora Nation, and the
              Burramattagal people of the Darug Nation. We acknowledge their
              ongoing practices of making, thinking and sharing on, of and with
              these lands, with an awareness that we are beneficiaries of the
              ongoing colonial project. <br /><br />
              The thoughts we share here have their roots in the project

                  dip or a potential fall, then bridges are everywhere. A
                  spider’s web is a series of bridges - but also a home, and a
                  trap. I’m on a friend’s deck and gum leaves have fallen across
                  gaps in the boards. Gentle, temporary bridges across tiny
                  abysses. Just under a year ago the leaves here were all black
                  and charred, or ash-soft and grey. Today the colours are back,
                  there is a cool breeze, and things feel held – suspended – at
                  least for now.

                  I'd like to try turning an idea into something using my hands,
                  but 2 hands are needed and that leaves... no hands to film it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am at home, as we have all been over these past months, but
                  it feels rare and special to be alone now, in a way that I
                  never appreciated. And hard to be alone in a way that I so
                  often ignored.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I try to nestle my phone in the hollow between my chin and
                  clavicle. It keeps sliding. You watch it slip; you watch me
                  slip. I keep catching it. Maybe this isn't going to work. And
                  then, just like that, it holds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My hands move quickly, working towards each other; this is the
                  moment I have to act, and who knows how many more of these
                  moments there will be, or how long they may last?
                </p>
                <p>This would be so much easier with more than 2 hands.</p>

                  I am makeshift, provisional, impermanent. A conglomerate of
                  things that would never come into contact, except to form this
                  temporary structure in space. Parts of me have seen the sharp
                  edge of a blade, the bristles of a paintbrush, the inside of a
                  dog’s mouth. Now the oily pads of fingers, walking, tickling,
                  marking space and time. I hold fast but am tethered to my own
                  precarity. I am bridge as obstacle, not thoroughfare. I am a
                  reminder –
                </p>
                <p>That the easiest way is not always the best.</p>
                <p>
                  That there are always unseen things to be crossed over or
                  connected.

                  perspective.

                  I am coiled, around myself. Always surrounded by myself. It
                  can be suffocating. My fibres nano-hard, angular, scratching,
                  rubbing; my whole flexible, pliant, they even call me 'soft'.
                  Slid between others like me, I can feel myself crawled along
                  spines, so long that I forget where I end and begin. I am
                  pushed against bones, books, pulled into knots, veiled,
                  staring up through skirts, or your pant leg. I recoil.

              Recently, we've seen actually how fragile this world is. New
              cracks are appearing in the (capitalist/settler-colonial) facade,
              through which we can see small glimpses of another world. What
              role will we play cultivating their growth? It's important to have
              faith in them the same way we know a small sprout can one day be
              infallible old growth. We all have a role to play, and we can't
              afford to lose hope.

                <p>
                  I've always had trouble envisioning the future, but spending
                  time each day sketching a clear picture of one I'd like to see
                  everyday is helping me ground myself and face the right
                  direction. Around where I live, I see kids running through the
                  broken fences of different blocks without a care. I'd love to
                  see the red brick apartment blocks free to flourish. I'm just
                  about to finish up a Horticulture apprenticeship because I
                  have a friend who dreams of reclaiming and healing his land,
                  and another who wants to feed their neighbourhood. To be
                  honest, I'd love to see these fences rid of entirely so we can
                  grow fresh fruit and vegetables for all the kids on the block.
                  While that might not be in the immediate future, I know at the
                  very least I'm sharpening my skills and gaining the tools to
                  plant those seeds. I wonder what might grow out of the ruins.

                  I wish these past few months was a period of quiet meditation,
                  but for many people (including myself), I know it wasn't. I
                  spent a lot of time wrestling with God and struggling with my
                  demons. Many I realised had been haunting me for years. But
                  I've also learnt to meet reality on it's own terms and see
                  things plainly for what they are. I've become aware of my own
                  need for a strong foundation, a firm core and roots that run
                  deep enough to weather a storm. I didn't get the period of
                  quiet meditation I was hoping for, but nothing is really
                  promised to us is it? Regardless, I'm determined to regain my
                  footing and turn this hard-earned, newfound awareness into
                  embodied change. The realisation I keep returning to is that
                  we rarely are afforded the luxury of quiet study - we've got
                  to learn on our feet.

                  I'm trying to pray every night before I sleep. I've been
                  trying to read the Bible again. I've been trying to be
                  stubborn in my belief that none of this is permanent. I've
                  been trying to renew heart in a world that threatens to slowly
                  erode yours away. I've been listening to sermons while I work
                  out on my bedroom floor. It might be some weird way of
                  embodying spiritual growth or it might be a self-punishing
                  ideal that Filipino Catholics can be known for. I wish I could
                  say I was devout, or faithful, or committed to spiritual
                  practice. The truth is I'm not. But having faith, I'm
                  realising, is knowing in your heart the truth - that love and
                  justice do bind us together; that everyone has intrinsic,
                  untouchable value; and that one day, the artifice built to
                  disrespect this must crumble away. Everyday I water a
                  fledgling plant knowing one day it will grow into a tree with
                  a large, strong trunk - one that I hope will outlive me and
                  provide fruit long after I'm gone.
