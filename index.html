              Since time immemorial Aboriginal people have been the continuing
              custodians of this country now known as Australia. This land, its
              oceans and skies, and miyarnu* have provided everything.<br /><br />
              These natural elements hold sacred knowledge and we too are made
              up of the same, this knowledge penetrates everything we know today
              and radiates energy from the beginning of time.<br /><br />
              The intention for my Rituals for Renewal posts is to slow down,
              make space and remember this innate connection and interconnection
              to Country.<br /><br />

                  Slowing down and watching a child connect with the world,
                  warms the softest spaces of my heart. This intergenerational
                  artwork with my son Bidi-Bidi was made on Warrain Beach from
                  gathering shells and seaweed we found along our walk. After we
                  made the work, we wonder how many days it might last, was it
                  the ocean that would reclaimed its belongings, or the sand, or
                  the wind or all of them interconnected?.

                  The grinding stone is a commonly used tool by our ancestors to

                  Working the rocks surfaces together until we find the sweet
                  spot in the palm of the hand, this circular repetitive action
                  evokes memories that are interwoven within our bones, and as
                  we listened we wondered was it the rock making the sound, the

              What difficult feelings arise as we meet upon the common
              ground?<br /><br />
              What contexts, narratives and histories are carried into social
              media through the very act of treading?<br /><br />
              This ground, like all digital spaces, is not neutral. It is
              neither static, nor liminal. It is not a third space. This ground
              is tethered to its history. As routers connect us to a myriad of
              global networks, so too do they speak back to the land from which
              we access it. Entangled with the ongoing colonial histories that
              shape us and our digital infrastructures.<br /><br />
              It is here, as a settler invader, living & working on Gadigial
              land, I hold these complexities to account. I acknowledge that
              this ground is not always safe. Nor is it inherently a network of
              care or mutual aid. It is not a replacement for community. It is
              not everyone’s medium.<br /><br />
              But it is mine.<br /><br />
              So, I’ll share how emergent digital communities can be better
              understood through acts of feeling— online. I want to remind us of
              the painful tensions that arise when we attempt to be together. I
              wanna remember that joy doesn't negate pain. I want to see the
              little x at the end of a text message as a gift and not an ending.
              This ritual is non-exhaustive, unsettled and in flux.

                  Communities. I think it unsettles a lot of the issues present
                  with our new reliance on digital media as a type of community.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Arts orgs / galleries / artists need to carefully examine how
                  they devise and transform their ~digital~ content rn. This
                  push towards live talks/streams in replacement of events does
                  not fulfil the affective role that they would have otherwise
                  served their cohort (not community).
                </p>
                <p>
                  This pandemic has shifted many arts ecologies online,
                  facilitating access to talks, lectures, and cultural content
                  that probably should have already been available through these
                  mediums.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Still, there is necessary &amp; vital work to be done on art
                  that intersects with digital platforms, on how it employs, and
                  relies on digital infrastructures (Think Facebook Live or this
                  Instagram account) which ultimately serve to perpetuate their
                  role in US global imperialism. What would a collective of
                  people look like outside of these frameworks? How do these
                  infrastructures impact the way we get together right now?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Anyway, I’ll be sharing a video essay in the next couple of
                  days on recent digital activism, emotions and the somatics of
                  Instagram. Stay tuned for a reading list too.

                    aria-describedby="White text on orange to green gradient background reads Difficult Feelings, The Black Square &amp; Instagram: A Video Essay. Text reads: Right now we’re endeavouring to find comfort in our discomfort. Searching for ways to tolerate our distress. We cling to the silver linings, regurgitating them everytime the Group Chat gets a little TOO heavy. These emotions will force us to act... right. It’s June 2nd 2020. We’re a couple weeks into lockdown, and a week away from the Stop Black Deaths In Custody rally and Vigil For George Floyd held on gadigal land. For settlers engaging with this for this first time it felt like we’re on the precipice of something big. Protests have erupted across the US, and around the globe, aided in part by the rapid dissemination of footage directly from demonstrators on the ground. You Know not too long ago, logging in to social media felt like a call to action. There was a sense of urgency as we storied protest safety tips, bail funds and infographics to our instagrams. We warned each other not to lose momentum, but also not to burn out. To keep informed, stay recording, and continue to spread the reality. At the same time, lockdown during this global pandemic had turned social media into our primary means of connection. We were in a long-distance relationship with everyone. Every phone call, text, zoom meeting, and message reminded us of that distance. I mean some of us even started dedicating days to baking bread, literally watching gluten develop in order to cope. -Bite bread here- These events had transformed social media into an unavoidable window, looking in, we were confronted with the material impacts of white supremacy. Intimacy and distance intertwined. It was uncomfortable, unavoidable, and frankly necessary. Fuelling a collective outpouring of guilt, hopelessness, anger, fatigue, and shame. Logging off was not an option anymore. I remember having conversations with friends who anxiously rehearsed their fatigue, and accompanying guilt. Like, their shame was productive precisely because it was a form of self punishment. Like “feeling bad” was evidence of their compassion. As settler-invaders who benefit from the ongoing colonial violence, our actions carry the potential to harm. And yes I agree non bla(c)k feelings need to be de-centred in our justice work, we should be trying to understand why they emerge. Emotions are not just things we have, they are not objects neatly passed between us unchanged.  They drag our contexts along with them. Emotions, by their very nature evoke movement, they drive our encounters and disconnections. As *Sara Ahmed writes &#39;The relationship between movement and attachment is instructive, what moves us, what makes us feel, is also which holds us in place [...].  Hence movement does not cut the body off from the where of its inhabitance, but connects bodies to other bodies: attachment takes place through movement, through being moved by the proximity of others.&#39; Our emotions reflect our orientations and carry with them narratives shaped by the world, which in turn shape the way we move through that world. Even Online. PART 1: The Black Square. By now you’re probably familiar with the events of BlackOutTuesday, a digital day of action started by former Atlantic Records employees Brianna Agyemang and Jamila Thomas that resulted in many Instagram feeds looking like an endless sea of BlackSquares. This action asked members of the music industry to pause operations for a day and reflect on the ways they specifically profit off of black artists and black culture, while simultaneously disenfranchising black communities. In researching this video, I noticed dozens of articles published shortly after the 2nd Of June. Each touting the movement as an example of digital activism done wrong Like or performative at best, and a valuable lesson in protest suppression online. Think of the emotional resonance of Kony 2012. The proliferation of the movement across social media was both spearheaded and critiqued by prominent black musicians, and quickly misapplied by companies, influencers, and our peers alike. It&#39;s worth noting that nowhere in the official statements from the organisers or on their website do they mention the sharing of plain black images. Two critiques emerged in response to BlackOutTuesday, the first being that it buried content pertaining to current protests archived beneath the BlackLivesMatter and BLM hashtag. Which was important at the time because the protests were getting minimal coverage on local primetime news stations. Social media was an alternative, and extremely accessible way to stay informed. Feminista Jones, an author, and longtime organizer, said  it took over 7 years to accumulate 11.9 million posts under the hashtags for BlackLivesMatter, and in under 7 hours on Black Out Tuesday that content was buried beneath a million new posts, which were mostly plain black tiles. Now, The second critique was that BlackOutTuesday was this sort of perfect storm, occurring in a time of radical upheaval, where non black people were bearing witness to the violence of white supremacy they directly benefited from. BlackOut Tuesday was easily coopted and removed from its organisers original intention because non-black people were desperately searching a way to demonstrate they were part of the movement. In a sense, the Black Tile was a vehicle under which non-black people could performatively assign themselves as one of the good ones. Just ask Ariana Grande, or Katie holmes…. Or Cotton On, or even NIDA, or what about Kendell? PART 2: One of the Good Ones. So, assuming you’re extremely online like me, and therefore have seen the sheer number of infographics on “how to be a good ally” you’re probably familiar with the concept of performativity in activism. You’re also probably aware that it’s something to avoid. It’s a quote unquote bad thing. Effectively, performative allyship is about gestures we make hoping to signal our solidarity with a certain cause or movement to an intended audience. It&#39;s an action concerned with being witnessed in our performance. Driven by, at times, by a deep-rooted desire to belong which we then validate through the accumulation of social capital. On Instagram, that&#39;s likes, follows, comments etc. It’s sort of pleasure-seeking behaviour, in that it’s harm comes from its capacity to alleviate the uncomfortable feelings that propel us to act in the first place. Sort of like screaming at your homophobic uncle across the dinner table. Like it felt good for you, but you’d be lying if you said if he voted yes. My fellow settler invaders, I don’t want this to be a paranoid reading on the problematics of sharing infographics on Instagram. I think user-generated content is useful in distilling complex ideas into yummy bite size pieces. It has the capacity to create alternative avenues for dialogue between peers across various levels of access. Hell, I even created one during the week of BlackOutTuesday because I was having the same conversation with multiple white friends about their ~digital fatigue~ and ~distress tolerance~. Which to be real with you all I’m hearing is “ it&#39;s A LOT to be white right now.” sad face. But these infographics, like the squares, are an articulation of our desire to belong to the movement. They alleviate our urge for immediate action. In the same way, the Black tiles we posted were rewarded by likes and comments which in turn confirmed our successful performance. Leading us to return the favour to others. But the nature of Instagrams architecture, governed by engagement algorithms, propels certain types of content to the top of the feed. It’s a self-serving process when hundreds of non-black people share and like each other posts, when we’re meant to be planning future social justice efforts. As these criticisms emerged, I think a lot of us were thrown back into a state of panic and discomfort. We fucked up.  And in that frantic search for a new way to perform along the path of least resistance, came, corrective commenting. PART 3: Kill The Cop In Your Head (and The Comment Section). Now I use corrective commenting here in an attempt to distinguish this act from calling out, or cancel culture. Both of which, despite current discourse, hold important socio-technical history in Black digital activism. Originating in the early 2010s from black twitter, and Tumblr. Cancel culture and calling out was originally a means to confront corporations and celebrities, basically any institutions that held significant social and economic capital over marginalised individuals. These people, predominately, black, trans, disabled, and queer understood that their identities, communities and interests were not being served, and at worst, were being actively harmed. So, call out and cancel culture was a cultural boycott, a way for a systematically oppressed group of individuals to mobilise together. To the point where people like… Pauline Hanson, The Murdoch Press, and your author who must not be named are calling for its removal. Anti cancel culture often borrows from the same kind of language that’s used to discredit other collective actions -. Framing cancel culture as irrational, over-emotional, and fueled by young people mirrors the same exact narratives which seek to discredit actions like looting and rioting. As if the optics of the revolution would be posted to your feed in the form of a black tile. While some people might get caught up with the semantics of tone, and respectability politics, I want to make this distinction very clear here, because I think these tactics are useful attempts to confront bodies of power. They acknowledge that transformative justice requires both parties to be present and willing, and use collective action in order to do so. We can’t begin the accountability process with an ex if they refuse to open the text message. Think of it as the beginning, not the end. Instead, we should be looking at how punishment is implemented across all scales in our society. How it moves between us in our interpersonal relations and more importantly how it functions inside of us. but this can only happen when we also examine which communities/ppl are being punished, how that punishment is institutionalised and reinforced across those same scales. I mean, we’re calling for prison abolition whilst acting like screws in the comment section, effectively replacing the prison industrial complex with our close friends list. So, in the aftermath of the Black Squares, corrective commenting was the practice of informing others via the comments that they should either take the post down or remove the hashtag. I’m Sure, the intention of these comments was probably on some level about protecting the BLM feed. But I’m concerned with how these moves interpolate non-black people as moderators, or gatekeepers of justice work, and ultimately hail us to police one another to the detriment of the movement. By informing others in the public amphitheatre of the comment section, there’s a tendency for us to play into carceral tropes of innocence. It becomes another avenue which allows us to move from our difficult feelings without doing our own work on ourselves. We need to confront and interrogate why we seek to position ourselves so highly in social justice work and disrupt the colonial narratives that make us centre our feelings. As Jackie Wang (Carceral Capitalism, 2019) writes: &#39;The invocation of personal security and safety presses on our affective and emotional registers and can thus be manipulated to justify everything from racial profiling to war. When people use safe-space language to call out people in activist spaces, the one wielding the language is framed as innocent, and may even amplify or politicize their presumed innocence. When people identify with their victimization, it is important to critically consider whether they use this gesture as a tactical manoeuvre to construct themselves as innocent and exert power in a social space. That does not mean delegitimizing the claims made by survivors, but rather, rejecting the framework of innocence, examining each situation closely, and remaining cognizant of the multiple power struggles at play in different conflicts.&#39; I think when we’re having these dialogues online whether it be in the dms, group chat, or the comment section of your nans latest cracked political facebook status... or even if it’s people you know who identify and align themselves within the social justice movement, we need to ask ourselves some questions: Like, What emotions come up when I see others post about social justice or anti racist work? When I share infographics on Instagram, what emotions come up just before I post? Where do they go afterwards? If lots of people are sharing the post, is there any way I can add to the dialogue more tangibly (Donate? Talk to friends? Organise to support local communities impacted?) When do conversations around cancel culture provide necessary dialogue about growth and mistakes, and when do they simply seek to derail meaningful collective action? If someone makes a mistake due to a lack of information and I correct them, am I interacting with the intention to help them learn? Or am I simply demonstrating that I know more? Or that I am better? Has someone with more lived experience or connection to this movement said something about it already? I could I share and uplift that voice instead of centring myself? Because there’s a big difference between being a good ally and being seen as good. Because there’s a big difference between being a good ally and being seen as good."

                  I associate the notion of rituals with that of intentional
                  action. Being mindful of the way our bodies move in certain
                  spaces, of comfort and ease. At the same time, I consider how
                  these ideas might permeate into our digital movements and
                  encounters online. This video essay considers the ways
                  non-Bla(c)k people centre our feelings in anti-racist work,
                  using the events of #BlackOutTuesday as a digital case study.
                  It is not a critique of the digital action, or
                  Bla(c)kLivesMatter, but rather a way to consider how our
                  (non-Bla(c)k) emotions reflect colonial narratives and restage
                  themselves online.

              Right now there is a global pandemic happening. A world wide
              health crisis. Chronically ill and disabled people have unique
              perceptions of this time based on enduring our own ongoing health
              crises. Our voices and lives are often ignored and erased so I
              choose to platform them in this space. 💛

I realised that listening to complaints from other work colleagues about teaching online and the difficulties they were facing with it. I actually… I rose to the challenge. I found it exciting, it was like having to learn new methods of working. Having to think outside the square to solve the problems. And they’re all skills as a disabled person that you’re using all the time because you are forever trying to think okay well how do I do this when I can’t just use brute force or I can’t lift something or move something or do the art that I want to do? I need to think outside the box to be able to come up with a solution so I can make art without draining or deleting my energies and I found very much that I was excited by the challenge. I really I loved you know experimenting with cyanotype and playing with pochoir. It was just fantastic and when I taught online my students picked up on that enthusiasm that I felt that this was an opportunity to be really experimental to try something completely new that we don’t usually use and to just play to have to give ourselves a chance to play with it and see what comes of it trying to make the best of the situation we’re facing rather than focusing on the negatives of what we couldn’t do."

              This year we made a project about bridges on the other side of the
              world, and we’ve been trying to make bridges to it since. To
              connect with it, draw it out, make it mean something. To create
              connections between continents and languages, and engage with
              strangers when we can’t be face to face, share a cuppa, share
              silence. <br /><br />
              For Rituals for Renewal, we’re starting a daily ritual that is
              small, contained and introspective. It’s a way of examining that
              project, but no longer trying to cast a web across the world.
              Seeing what happens when we build things with materials and
              objects close to hand, and use this as a way of thinking from the
              inside out. <br /><br />
              This ritual is an antidote to making work we cannot see or touch;
              a return to using our hands for something other than typing
              emails. We will be making, thinking and posting from the unceded
              lands of the Gadigal and Wangal people of the Eora Nation, and the
              Burramattagal people of the Darug Nation. We acknowledge their
              ongoing practices of making, thinking and sharing on, of and with
              these lands, with an awareness that we are beneficiaries of the
              ongoing colonial project. <br /><br />
              The thoughts we share here have their roots in the project

                  I’m replacing curtains with blinds at my grandmother’s flat.
                  The first step is removing the reeded hardwood curtain rods,
                  dusty and dry but straight and true after decades spanning the
                  threshold between inside and out. Outside it’s getting too
                  hot, too bright, and inside it’s full of buttons and half-made
                  things and dust, so much dust.

                  A scent carries you, stretching your fibres, tugging at your
                  veins, spanning a bridge between moments, memories. Elaborate
                  architectures spring up on either side.

                  shadowy drapery of a back alley fence. I am taken, splayed

                  If a bridge is anything formed to ease passage over a drop, a
                  dip or a potential fall, then bridges are everywhere. A
                  spider’s web is a series of bridges - but also a home, and a
                  trap. I’m on a friend’s deck and gum leaves have fallen across
                  gaps in the boards. Gentle, temporary bridges across tiny
                  abysses. Just under a year ago the leaves here were all black
                  and charred, or ash-soft and grey. Today the colours are back,
                  there is a cool breeze, and things feel held – suspended – at
                  least for now.

                  I am at home, as we have all been over these past months, but
                  it feels rare and special to be alone now, in a way that I
                  never appreciated. And hard to be alone in a way that I so
                  often ignored.

                  I try to nestle my phone in the hollow between my chin and
                  clavicle. It keeps sliding. You watch it slip; you watch me
                  slip. I keep catching it. Maybe this isn't going to work. And
                  then, just like that, it holds.

                  My hands move quickly, working towards each other; this is the
                  moment I have to act, and who knows how many more of these
                  moments there will be, or how long they may last?

                  I am makeshift, provisional, impermanent. A conglomerate of
                  things that would never come into contact, except to form this
                  temporary structure in space. Parts of me have seen the sharp
                  edge of a blade, the bristles of a paintbrush, the inside of a
                  dog’s mouth. Now the oily pads of fingers, walking, tickling,
                  marking space and time. I hold fast but am tethered to my own
                  precarity. I am bridge as obstacle, not thoroughfare. I am a
                  reminder –
                </p>
                <p>That the easiest way is not always the best.</p>

                  I am coiled, around myself. Always surrounded by myself. It
                  can be suffocating. My fibres nano-hard, angular, scratching,
                  rubbing; my whole flexible, pliant, they even call me 'soft'.
                  Slid between others like me, I can feel myself crawled along
                  spines, so long that I forget where I end and begin. I am
                  pushed against bones, books, pulled into knots, veiled,
                  staring up through skirts, or your pant leg. I recoil.

              Recently, we've seen actually how fragile this world is. New
              cracks are appearing in the (capitalist/settler-colonial) facade,
              through which we can see small glimpses of another world. What
              role will we play cultivating their growth? It's important to have
              faith in them the same way we know a small sprout can one day be
              infallible old growth. We all have a role to play, and we can't
              afford to lose hope.

                <p>
                  I've always had trouble envisioning the future, but spending
                  time each day sketching a clear picture of one I'd like to see
                  everyday is helping me ground myself and face the right
                  direction. Around where I live, I see kids running through the
                  broken fences of different blocks without a care. I'd love to
                  see the red brick apartment blocks free to flourish. I'm just
                  about to finish up a Horticulture apprenticeship because I
                  have a friend who dreams of reclaiming and healing his land,
                  and another who wants to feed their neighbourhood. To be
                  honest, I'd love to see these fences rid of entirely so we can
                  grow fresh fruit and vegetables for all the kids on the block.
                  While that might not be in the immediate future, I know at the
                  very least I'm sharpening my skills and gaining the tools to
                  plant those seeds. I wonder what might grow out of the ruins.

                <p>
                  I wish these past few months was a period of quiet meditation,
                  but for many people (including myself), I know it wasn't. I
                  spent a lot of time wrestling with God and struggling with my
                  demons. Many I realised had been haunting me for years. But
                  I've also learnt to meet reality on it's own terms and see
                  things plainly for what they are. I've become aware of my own
                  need for a strong foundation, a firm core and roots that run
                  deep enough to weather a storm. I didn't get the period of
                  quiet meditation I was hoping for, but nothing is really
                  promised to us is it? Regardless, I'm determined to regain my
                  footing and turn this hard-earned, newfound awareness into
                  embodied change. The realisation I keep returning to is that
                  we rarely are afforded the luxury of quiet study - we've got
                  to learn on our feet.

                <p>Life is hard, so do I have to be hard too?</p>
                <p>
                  I'm trying to pray every night before I sleep. I've been
                  trying to read the Bible again. I've been trying to be
                  stubborn in my belief that none of this is permanent. I've
                  been trying to renew heart in a world that threatens to slowly
                  erode yours away. I've been listening to sermons while I work
                  out on my bedroom floor. It might be some weird way of
                  embodying spiritual growth or it might be a self-punishing
                  ideal that Filipino Catholics can be known for. I wish I could
                  say I was devout, or faithful, or committed to spiritual
                  practice. The truth is I'm not. But having faith, I'm
                  realising, is knowing in your heart the truth - that love and
                  justice do bind us together; that everyone has instrinsic,
                  untouchable value; and that one day, the artifice built to
                  disrespect this must crumble away. Everyday I water a
                  fledgling plant knowing one day it will grow into a tree with
                  a large, strong trunk - one that I hope will outlive me and
                  provide fruit long after I'm gone.
